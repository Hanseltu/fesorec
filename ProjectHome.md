We developed a range of exact and heuristic techniques for optimized feature selection with resource constraints in software product lines.
Exact techniques: CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) based on Choco (http://www.emn.fr/z-info/choco-solver/), FCF (Filtered Cartesian Flattening, linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121209000284)+BBLP (Branch and Bound with Linear Programming);
Heuristic techniques: FCF+M-HEU (http://www.springerlink.com/content/4unc1t2eene1l8yd/), GA, ACO.
The GA-based and ACO-based approaches are developed in Java SE 6, Eclipse Galileo 3.5.2.
